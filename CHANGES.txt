1.1.0 (2010-01-25)
==================

Features
--------

- Added translation to XLS export files.

- Added creator, last modifier and modification date metadata to
  objects.

Bugfixes
--------

- When two users are exporting at the same time this could end in
  broken export files.

- On the person edit form:

  - the the last modification dates of the entries (postal address,
    phone number etc.) where the one of the person.

  - the keywords field was not correctly implemented: it was always
    marked as changed so the a new last modification date on the
    person was set, even when nothing has been changed.

  - editing a field of an entry did not change the modification date
    of this entry but of the person.


1.0.1 (2010-01-13)
==================

- Bugfix: The value fields of a user defined field of type `choice`

1.0.0 (2009-12-29)
==================

- Translated UI into German.

- Displaying modification date of adresses now.

- Dropped some package dependencies which existed for compatibility

==================

- Users which are defined inside an address book having the
  `Administrator` role, were not able to edit address book entities.


0.5.3 (2009-11-22)
==================

- After the last fix `delete all persons` did not delete any
  persons. This is now fixed.


0.5.2 (2009-11-21)
==================

- `Delete all persons` no longer tries to delete the persons which are
  users. Previously this function broke when there were users defined
  in the address book.

- Moved the function to delete a whole address book to the overview
  page of all address books, as users defined inside an address book
  are not allowed to delete their address book.


0.5.1 (2009-11-21)
==================

- Fixed namespace package declaration so the package can be installed
  on a plain vanilla python (even without setuptools installed).

================

- Users having the role `Administrator` can add new fields to address
  book entities in the master data area. These fields as useable for
  editors and visitors, too.

Removed features
----------------

- Removed some fields which are not always necessary and which can be
  re-added when needed as user defined fields:

  - state field on the postal address (only displayed German
    states, though),

  - sex field on person,

  - notes fields on address book, postal address, phone number, e-mail
    address, home page address, file and keyword,

  - kind fields on postal address, phone number, e-mail address and
    home page address.


Bug fixes
---------

- Uploading a new file changes the stored name of the file.

- When uploading a file with an unknown mime type (aka
  `application/octet-stream`) the actual mime type is guessed using
  the file extension and file content.

- The person list is now ordered by the displayed titles instead of
  the internal ids.


0.4 (2009-05-15)
================

Features
--------

- Files can be uploaded and added to persons. (Files are stored as
  ZODB-Blob-Objects.)

- Added logging of page accesses to `access.log`.

- ``install.py`` now asks for hostname and portnumber and logging
  configuration, so changing ``deploy.ini`` is no longer necessary.
