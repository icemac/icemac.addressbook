1.8.1 (unreleased)
==================

-----

- Updated other dependent packages (outside ZTK) to newest versions.


1.8.0 (2011-12-14)
==================

Features
--------

- Added search result handler which allows to send an e-mail to the persons
  found by the search.

Bugfixes
--------

- The search result handler which updates data did not handle keywords well,
  it was not possible to remove a keyword from a person using that handler.


Other
-----

- Added some Screenshots_ to the SourceForge_ page.

- Using `Chameleon 2` as HTML render engine resulting in faster page
  rendering. (Test run in half of the time now.)

- Updated to `Zope Toolkit 1.1.3`_ for dependent packages.

- Updated other dependent packages (outside ZTK) to newest versions.

  reasons with older versions. Data gets converted during first start-up.

1.7.0 (2011-11-03)
==================

General
-------

- Dropped support for Python 2.5, so currently only Python 2.6 is supported.


UI changes
----------

- Previously search results could only be exported. The options have been
  widened, so different handlings of search results are possible. So
  deletion of the selected persons has been moved to these search result
  handlers.

- Added explanation text to search from.

Features
--------

- Added a new search type: Search for person names. You may use wildcards in
  this search (? for a single character or * for multiple characters).

- Search results now display the columns the user selected in his personal
  preferences.

- Added search result handler to modify a single field on all selected persons
  in the search result. Depending on the kind of the field different operations
  are possible (replace with, append to, remove from, add to, multipy with,
  intersect with, ...). Only users with "Administrator" role can use this
  handler as wrong usage might be dangerous for the data.


Bug fixes
---------

- Running the address book in a vhost environment did not allow to access the
  about screen, as it was only registered for the root folder.

Other
-----

- Updated to `Zope Toolkit 1.1`_ for dependent packages.

- Integrated `decorator` package into distribution as needed version is
  prone to disappear from PyPI.

- Changed test setup to use `plone.testing` layer.

1.6.0 (2011-02-03)
==================

Features
--------

- Added ability to sort the fields of the entities.

Bug fixes
---------

- It is no longer possible to add new fields to the 'main adresses and
  numbers' entity as it makes no sense and breaks the address book.
