1.7.0 (unreleased)
==================

General
-------

- Dropped support for Python 2.5, so currently only Python 2.6 is supported.


Features
--------

- Added a new search: Search for person names. You may use wildcards in this
  search (? for a single character or * for multiple characters).

- Search results now display the columns the user selected in his personal
  preferences.

UI changes
----------

- Previously search results could only be exported. The options have been
  widened, so different handlings of search results are possible. So
  deletion of the selected persons has been moved to these search result
  handlers.


Other
-----

- Integrated `decorator` package into distribution as needed version is
  prone to disappear from PyPI.

1.6.0 (2011-02-03)
==================

Features
--------

- Added ability to sort the fields of the entities.

Bug fixes
---------

- It is no longer possible to add new fields to the 'main adresses and
  numbers' entity as it makes no sense and breaks the address book.


1.5.0 (2010-11-23)
==================

Features
--------

- Added support for Python 2.6.

- Added an "about addressbook" view which shows the version number. The blue
  "i" right of "icemac.addressbook" in each view is a link to it.

- Added messages telling about successful actions, e. g. applying or
  canceling a form.

- Made it possible to sort the entities.

- Made 'main adresses and numbers' an entity, so it could be sorted along
  with the other entities.

- Added ability to delete the persons found in a search. User must have the
  administrator role to use this feature as it might be dangerous.

- Added installation option to configure that the address book process sould
  run as another user than the one who started it.

Bug fixes
---------

- When copying a person, the creation dates and modification dates of the
  addresses in the copied person are changed along the person.
