0.5.5 (unreleased)
==================

- Nothing changed yet.


0.5.4 (2009-12-20)
==================

- Users which are defined inside an address book having the
  `Administrator` role, were not able to edit address book entities.


0.5.3 (2009-11-22)
==================

- After the last fix `delete all persons` did not delete any
  persons. This is now fixed.


0.5.2 (2009-11-21)
==================

- `Delete all persons` no longer tries to delete the persons which are
  users. Previously this function broke when there were users defined
  in the address book.

- Moved the function to delete a whole address book to the overview
  page of all address books, as users defined inside an address book
  are not allowed to delete their address book.


0.5.1 (2009-11-21)
==================

- Fixed namespace package declaration so the package can be installed
  on a plain vanilla python (even without setuptools installed).


0.5 (2009-11-21)
================

Features
--------

- Users having the role `Administrator` can delete all persons in the
  address book or even the whole address book on the address book edit
  form.

- Last modification time of objects is now stored and displayed (in
  UTC!).

- Users having the role `Administrator` can import data in the master
  data area.

- Added ability to enter additional packages names at installation
  (e. g. to install a specific import file readers).

- Users having the role `Administrator` can add new fields to address
  book entities in the master data area. These fields as useable for
  editors and visitors, too.

Removed features
----------------

- Removed some fields which are not always necessary and which can be
  re-added when needed as user defined fields:

  - state field on the postal address (only displayed German
    states, though),

  - sex field on person,

  - notes fields on address book, postal address, phone number, e-mail
    address, home page address, file and keyword,

  - kind fields on postal address, phone number, e-mail address and
    home page address.


Bug fixes
---------

- Uploading a new file changes the stored name of the file.

- When uploading a file with an unknown mime type (aka
  `application/octet-stream`) the actual mime type is guessed using
  the file extension and file content.

- The person list is now ordered by the displayed titles instead of
  the internal ids.


0.4 (2009-05-15)
================

Features
--------

- Files can be uploaded and added to persons. (Files are stored as
  ZODB-Blob-Objects.)

- Added logging of page accesses to `access.log`.

- ``install.py`` now asks for hostname and portnumber and logging
  configuration, so changing ``deploy.ini`` is no longer necessary.


0.3.3 (2009-04-05)
==================

- Added two package dependencies which are necessary to convert an
  existing ZODB of a previous address book version.


0.3.2 (2009-04-03)
==================

- Fixed the sort order of the links in the master data section.


0.3.1 (2009-03-31)
==================

- Fixed wrong recipe version.


0.3 (2009-03-31)
================

Features
--------

- Added user management. There is now only one administrative user
  created during installation. This user can log-in using basic
  auth. He can create new users from existing persons inside the
  address books (See `Master data --> Users`.)


Bug fixes
---------

- Made the AddressBook skin the default skin.


Other changes
-------------

- Dropped support for Python 2.4.

- Renamed role `icemac.addressbook.administrator` to
  `icemac.addressbook.global.administrator` so all global roles have
  the same naming scheme.

- Removed ZMI (Zope Management Interface) from skins in production
  environment. There is a buildout config in ``profiles/zmi.cfg``
  which enables ZMI.


Previous Versions
