 Persons
=========

A person has an ITitle adapter where the result depends on the values
set on the person.


    >>> import icemac.addressbook.person
    >>> import icemac.addressbook.interfaces
    >>> person = icemac.addressbook.person.Person()

When first and last name is not set, the whole name is a place
holder. This should never happen in reality as the last name is
required:

    >>> icemac.addressbook.interfaces.ITitle(person)
    u'<no name>'

When the last name is set but the first name is empty only the last
name is returned:

    >>> person.last_name = u'Tester'
    >>> icemac.addressbook.interfaces.ITitle(person)
    u'Tester'

If both first and last name exist, the whole name consists of the
combination of both:

    >>> person.first_name = u'Hans'
    >>> person.last_name = u'Tester'
    >>> icemac.addressbook.interfaces.ITitle(person)
    u'Tester, Hans'
