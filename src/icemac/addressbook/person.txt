 Persons
=========

A person has an ITitle adapter where the result depends on the values
set on the person.


    >>> import icemac.addressbook.person
    >>> import icemac.addressbook.interfaces
    >>> person = icemac.addressbook.person.Person()

If first and last name is not set, the whole name is a place
holder. This should never happen in reality as the last name is
required:

    >>> icemac.addressbook.interfaces.ITitle(person)
    u'<no name>'

If the last name is set but the first name is empty we try to compute
salutation form the sex of the person. If the sex is not set we only
return the last name:

    >>> person.last_name = u'Tester'
    >>> icemac.addressbook.interfaces.ITitle(person)
    u'Tester'
    >>> person.sex = u'male'
    >>> icemac.addressbook.interfaces.ITitle(person)
    u'Mr. Tester'
    >>> person.sex = u'female'
    >>> icemac.addressbook.interfaces.ITitle(person)
    u'Ms. Tester'

If both first and last name exist the whole name consists of the
combination of both:

    >>> person.first_name = u'Hans'
    >>> person.last_name = u'Tester'
    >>> icemac.addressbook.interfaces.ITitle(person)
    u'Tester, Hans'
