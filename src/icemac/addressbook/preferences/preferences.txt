==================
 User preferences
==================

There are user specific preferences in the address book:

Set up
======

We need an address book:

>>> from icemac.addressbook.testing import create_addressbook
>>> create_addressbook()
<AddressBook u'ab' (u'test address book')>

And a browser to access it:

>>> from zope.testbrowser.testing import Browser
>>> browser = Browser()
>>> browser.addHeader('Authorization', 'Basic mgr:mgrpw')
>>> browser.open('http://localhost/++skin++AddressBook/ab')

Location
========

There is a link in the main navigation which currently leads to the
person list preferences:

>>> browser.getLink('Preferences').click()
>>> browser.url
'http://localhost/++skin++AddressBook/ab/++preferences++/personList'

>>> print "Go on here"
>>> file('response.html', 'w').write(browser.contents)

.. to test
.. only accessable when logged in
.. accessable by editor, admin and visitor
.. differend users have different prefs
.. in separate file test that changing prefs changes person list behavior
