==================
 Default adapters
==================

There is an ITitle adapter which is used when no specific adapter is
registered:

>>> import icemac.addressbook.interfaces
>>> icemac.addressbook.interfaces.ITitle('asdf')
'asdf'
>>> icemac.addressbook.interfaces.ITitle(u'qwe')
u'qwe'
>>> icemac.addressbook.interfaces.ITitle(object())
'<object object at 0x...>'
