1.10.0 (2013-06-21)
===================

Features
--------

  provide roles which do not allow to access the persons in the address
  book.

  e. g. creation date, modification date and user defined fields of type
  datetime, are converted to the selected time zone. Default is UTC.

  the names of the selected persons (new in 1.9.0).

  headline inside the application.

==================

Features
--------

- Added search result handler which prints the names of the selected persons
  als comma separated list.


Bugfixes

1.8.1 (2012-04-20)
==================

Features
--------

- Added favicon.ico to the application.

- Split preferences into multiple groups.

Bugfixes
--------

- The search result handler which updates data did not update the catalog,
  so these changes were invisible for the search. Updated catalog and search
  result handler.

- User preferences were stored globally instead of locally in the address
  book of the user. Users with the same internal ID shared preferences
  across address books. As the internal IDs are simply a counter this
  happened every time if using the multi-client capability.

  The problem was fixed by storing user preferences locally and copying
  existing global preferences over to the each address book where a user for
  the internal user ID of the preferences exists.

Other
-----

- Updated other dependent packages (outside ZTK) to newest versions.

- Using Fanstatic – a WSGI middleware – to deliver CSS and JS instead of
  ``hurry.resource``.


1.8.0 (2011-12-14)
==================

Features
--------

- Added search result handler which allows to send an e-mail to the persons
  found by the search.

Bugfixes
--------

- The search result handler which updates data did not handle keywords well,
  it was not possible to remove a keyword from a person using that handler.


Other
-----

- Added some Screenshots_ to the SourceForge_ page.

- Using `Chameleon 2` as HTML render engine resulting in faster page
  rendering. (Test run in half of the time now.)

- Updated to `Zope Toolkit 1.1.3`_ for dependent packages.

- Updated other dependent packages (outside ZTK) to newest versions.

- Dropped some package dependencies which only existed for compatibility
  reasons with older versions. Data gets converted during first start-up.
