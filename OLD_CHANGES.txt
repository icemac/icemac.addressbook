=============

1.6.0 (2011-02-03)
==================

Features
--------

- Added ability to sort the fields of the entities.

Bug fixes
---------

- It is no longer possible to add new fields to the 'main adresses and
  numbers' entity as it makes no sense and breaks the address book.


1.5.0 (2010-11-23)
==================

Features
--------

- Added support for Python 2.6.

- Added an "about addressbook" view which shows the version number. The blue

  canceling a form.

- Made it possible to sort the entities.

- Made 'main adresses and numbers' an entity, so it could be sorted along
  with the other entities.

  administrator role to use this feature as it might be dangerous.

- Added installation option to configure that the address book process sould
  run as another user than the one who started it.

Bug fixes
---------

- When copying a person, the creation dates and modification dates of the
  addresses in the copied person are changed along the person.

  broken export files.

- On the person edit form:

  - the the last modification dates of the entries (postal address,
    phone number etc.) where the one of the person.

  - the keywords field was not correctly implemented: it was always
    marked as changed so the a new last modification date on the

    of this entry but of the person.

1.0.1 (2010-01-13)
==================

- Bugfix: The value fields of a user defined field of type `choice`

==================

- Translated UI into German.

- Displaying modification date of adresses now.

==================

- Users which are defined inside an address book having the
  `Administrator` role, were not able to edit address book entities.


0.5.3 (2009-11-22)
==================

- After the last fix `delete all persons` did not delete any
  persons. This is now fixed.

- `Delete all persons` no longer tries to delete the persons which are
  users. Previously this function broke when there were users defined
  in the address book.

  are not allowed to delete their address book.

==================

- Fixed namespace package declaration so the package can be installed
  on a plain vanilla python (even without setuptools installed).

================

Features
--------

- Users having the role `Administrator` can delete all persons in the
  address book or even the whole address book on the address book edit

  book entities in the master data area. These fields as useable for

  - notes fields on address book, postal address, phone number, e-mail
    address, home page address, file and keyword,

  - kind fields on postal address, phone number, e-mail address and
    home page address.


Bug fixes
---------

- Uploading a new file changes the stored name of the file.

- When uploading a file with an unknown mime type (aka
  `application/octet-stream`) the actual mime type is guessed using
  the file extension and file content.

- The person list is now ordered by the displayed titles instead of
  the internal ids.


0.4 (2009-05-15)
================

Features
--------

- Files can be uploaded and added to persons. (Files are stored as
  ZODB-Blob-Objects.)

- Added logging of page accesses to `access.log`.

  configuration, so changing ``deploy.ini`` is no longer necessary.


0.3.3 (2009-04-05)
==================

- Added two package dependencies which are necessary to convert an
  existing ZODB of a previous address book version.


0.3.2 (2009-04-03)

  address books (See `Master data --> Users`.)

---------

- Made the AddressBook skin the default skin.


Other changes
-------------

- Dropped support for Python 2.4.

- Renamed role `icemac.addressbook.administrator` to
  `icemac.addressbook.global.administrator` so all global roles have
  the same naming scheme.

- Removed ZMI (Zope Management Interface) from skins in production
  environment. There is a buildout config in ``profiles/zmi.cfg``
  which enables ZMI.

--------

- Multiple postal addresses, e-mail addresses, phone numbers and home
  page addresses per person are now possible.

  `address prefix` and `street`.

- Overview page of all address books now shows number of entries in
  each address book.

Bug fixes

  a picky constraint.

- After changing a keyword title, persons using this keyword where no
  longer found in the keyword search because the index was not
  updated.

  displayed before e-mail address. Changed XLS export accordingly.
