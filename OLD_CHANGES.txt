Features
--------

- Multiple postal addresses, e-mail addresses, phone numbers and home
  page addresses per person are now possible.

- Added XLS export for all stored data (not only the default
  addresses).

- Added new attribute `kind` to postal address. Split `street` into
  `address prefix` and `street`.

- Overview page of all address books now shows number of entries in
  each address book.

Bug fixes
---------

- E-Mail adresses with hyphen in host name where not enterable due to
  a picky constraint.

- After changing a keyword title, persons using this keyword where no
  longer found in the keyword search because the index was not
  updated.

- Changed sort order on person edit form: phone number is now
  displayed before e-mail address. Changed XLS export accordingly.
