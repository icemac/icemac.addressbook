=============

==================

  canceling a form.

- Made it possible to sort the entities.

- Made 'main adresses and numbers' an entity, so it could be sorted along

  run as another user than the one who started it.

- When two users are exporting at the same time this could end in
  broken export files.

- On the person edit form:

  - the the last modification dates of the entries (postal address,
    phone number etc.) where the one of the person.

  - the keywords field was not correctly implemented: it was always
    marked as changed so the a new last modification date on the
    person was set, even when nothing has been changed.

  - editing a field of an entry did not change the modification date
    of this entry but of the person.

1.0.1 (2010-01-13)
==================

- Bugfix: The value fields of a user defined field of type `choice`

==================

- Translated UI into German.

- Displaying modification date of adresses now.

- Dropped some package dependencies which existed for compatibility

==================

- Users which are defined inside an address book having the
  `Administrator` role, were not able to edit address book entities.


0.5.3 (2009-11-22)
==================

- After the last fix `delete all persons` did not delete any
  persons. This is now fixed.


0.5.2 (2009-11-21)

- `Delete all persons` no longer tries to delete the persons which are
  users. Previously this function broke when there were users defined
  in the address book.

  page of all address books, as users defined inside an address book
  are not allowed to delete their address book.


0.5.1 (2009-11-21)
==================

- Fixed namespace package declaration so the package can be installed
  on a plain vanilla python (even without setuptools installed).


0.5 (2009-11-21)
================

Features
--------

- Users having the role `Administrator` can delete all persons in the
  address book or even the whole address book on the address book edit
  form.

  UTC!).

  data area.

  book entities in the master data area. These fields as useable for
  editors and visitors, too.

Removed features
----------------

  re-added when needed as user defined fields:

  - state field on the postal address (only displayed German
    states, though),

  - sex field on person,

  - notes fields on address book, postal address, phone number, e-mail
    address, home page address, file and keyword,

  - kind fields on postal address, phone number, e-mail address and
    home page address.


Bug fixes
---------

- Uploading a new file changes the stored name of the file.

- When uploading a file with an unknown mime type (aka
  `application/octet-stream`) the actual mime type is guessed using
  the file extension and file content.

- The person list is now ordered by the displayed titles instead of
  the internal ids.


0.4 (2009-05-15)
================

Features
--------

- Files can be uploaded and added to persons. (Files are stored as
  ZODB-Blob-Objects.)

- Added logging of page accesses to `access.log`.

- ``install.py`` now asks for hostname and portnumber and logging
  configuration, so changing ``deploy.ini`` is no longer necessary.


0.3.3 (2009-04-05)
==================

- Added two package dependencies which are necessary to convert an
  existing ZODB of a previous address book version.


0.3.2 (2009-04-03)
==================

- Fixed the sort order of the links in the master data section.

  address books (See `Master data --> Users`.)


Bug fixes
---------

- Made the AddressBook skin the default skin.


Other changes
-------------

- Dropped support for Python 2.4.

- Renamed role `icemac.addressbook.administrator` to
  `icemac.addressbook.global.administrator` so all global roles have
  the same naming scheme.

- Removed ZMI (Zope Management Interface) from skins in production
  environment. There is a buildout config in ``profiles/zmi.cfg``
  which enables ZMI.


0.2 (2009-01-02)
================

Features
--------

- Multiple postal addresses, e-mail addresses, phone numbers and home
  page addresses per person are now possible.

  addresses).

  `address prefix` and `street`.

- Overview page of all address books now shows number of entries in
  each address book.

Bug fixes
---------

  a picky constraint.

- After changing a keyword title, persons using this keyword where no
  longer found in the keyword search because the index was not
  updated.

- Changed sort order on person edit form: phone number is now
  displayed before e-mail address. Changed XLS export accordingly.
