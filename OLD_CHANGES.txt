 Old changes
=============


0.3.3 (2009-04-05)
==================

- Added two package dependencies which are necessary to convert an
  existing ZODB of a previous address book version.


0.3.2 (2009-04-03)
==================

- Fixed the sort order of the links in the master data section.


0.3.1 (2009-03-31)
==================

- Fixed wrong recipe version.


0.3 (2009-03-31)
================

Features
--------

- Added user management. There is now only one administrative user
  created during installation. This user can log-in using basic
  auth. He can create new users from existing persons inside the
  address books (See `Master data --> Users`.)


Bug fixes
---------

- Made the AddressBook skin the default skin.


Other changes
-------------

- Dropped support for Python 2.4.

- Renamed role `icemac.addressbook.administrator` to
  `icemac.addressbook.global.administrator` so all global roles have
  the same naming scheme.

- Removed ZMI (Zope Management Interface) from skins in production
  environment. There is a buildout config in ``profiles/zmi.cfg``
  which enables ZMI.


0.2 (2009-01-02)
================

Features
--------

- Multiple postal addresses, e-mail addresses, phone numbers and home
  page addresses per person are now possible.

- Added XLS export for all stored data (not only the default
  addresses).

- Added new attribute `kind` to postal address. Split `street` into
  `address prefix` and `street`.

- Overview page of all address books now shows number of entries in
  each address book.

Bug fixes
---------

- E-Mail adresses with hyphen in host name where not enterable due to
  a picky constraint.

- After changing a keyword title, persons using this keyword where no
  longer found in the keyword search because the index was not
  updated.

- Changed sort order on person edit form: phone number is now
  displayed before e-mail address. Changed XLS export accordingly.

0.1.2 (2008-11-23)
==================
